### Goals for this Post

I do not intend for the *R for Nonprofits* series to be a resource for learning the basics of R -- there are plenty of resources out there for that, and also, no matter what learning resources you use, you won't truly become a proficient R programmer without working on your own projects.  

In this post, I intend to offer recommendations and resources so the reader can accomplish the following:

1. Successfully download R and RStudio.
1. Get started down an effective learning path.
1. Get started writing reports with RMarkdown.
1. Implement a version control workflow with Git.

For the more experienced useR, these will be pretty basic recommendations.  For those totally new to R and those who have just started to get their feet wet, I hope this post will speed up the learning and implementation process while helping to avoid some pitfalls that tripped me up when I was just getting started.
